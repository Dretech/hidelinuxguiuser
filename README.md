# hideguiuser

This program hides or unhides a Linux user in the list of names that can login in the Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Usage: hideguiuser username { yes | no }

The program does what it should do for me. At the moment I do not have plans for functionality improvements. Feel free to improve the code and then share the code back with the Open Source community. The GNU General Public License version 3.0 applies to this program.
